# pixel.js
HTML5 Graphics library that only supports pixels.
This is a small js file that allows you to create graphics out of nothing more than pixels. There are only 3 functions in the code file. To use it, just use a script tag to include the file into your site. Read the coe to determine how to make pixels(its not hard) and show me what you do with it.
